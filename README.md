Amdy helps learners study at their own pace, improves learner retention, allows the creation of a unique learning environment, and it can be deployed to employees world over at once.Research suggests that elearning has been shown to increase retention of information, and take less time, meaning the changes coronavirus have caused might be here to stay.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced numerours challenges throughout the journey. We faced some difficulties in the navigation part and later solved them with great effort.

## How we built Amdy
We used React Native in the frontend. Next, we designed and created login, registration and rest forms for users to register/login. We also added the payment gateway page with an awsome design of credit/debit cards. We designed and implemented a dashboard for the mentors and the most important feature in our app is, the user/learner can choose his/her favorite mentor from our mentors section which helps the user to develop his/her skills much faster and much comfortable.

## Technologies we used
    * React Native
    * HTML5
    * CSS
    * Javascript
