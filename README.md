## Challenges we ran into
We faced numerours challenges throughout the journey. We faced some difficulties in the navigation part and later solved them with great effort.

## How we built Amdy
We used React Native in the frontend. Next, we designed and created login, registration and rest forms for users to register/login. We also added the payment gateway page with an awsome design of credit/debit cards. We designed and implemented a dashboard for the mentors and the most important feature in our app is, the user/learner can choose his/her favorite mentor from our mentors section which helps the user to develop his/her skills much faster and much comfortable.

## Technologies we used
    * React Native
    * HTML5
    * CSS
